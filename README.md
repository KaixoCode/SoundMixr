Simple mixer made specifically for SAR (http://sar.audio/)

Very much still a work in progress, the basic functionality of routing audio from inputs to outputs works, although the GUI is not yet intuitive, which will change in the near future. Some of the future plans are:
 - Nicer GUI.
 - Audio volume level visuals.
 - Option to make the GUI vertical instead of horizontal.
